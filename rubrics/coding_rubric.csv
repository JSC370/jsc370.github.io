Planning of code and statistical analysis,Introductory comment describes overall strategy and gives evidence of preliminary planning. Thoughtful problem decomposition breaks the problem into independent pieces that can be solved easily.,"Evidence of planning before coding, but some flaws in overall strategy. ","More planning needed: overall strategy ok, but have missed some obvious ways of making the code simpler.","It all hangs together, but planning was absent or rushed.",No evidence of planning. Strategy deeply flawed.
Programming execution and reproducibility of results,"Mastery of Python/R vocabulary means that the absolute minimum amount of code is used to get the job done. Code free from duplication. Each function encapsulates a single task, and repeated tasks are performed by functions, not copy and paste","Workable, but not elegant.  Common programming idioms used to reduce code.","The code works, but copy-paste used often.","Most of the code works, but some parts do not work. Copy-paste used very often","Functions used inapproriately, or existing functions reinvented. Extensive use of copy and paste."
Programming Clarity,"Code is a pleasure to read, and easy to understand. Code and comments form part of a seamless whole.","Comments used to discuss the why, and not how of code; to provide insight into complicated algorithms; and to indicate purpose of function (if not obvious from its name). Comment headings used to separate important sections of the code.","Generally easy to read, but some comments used inappropriately: either too many, or too few. Some variable names confusing.",Hard to understand. Poor choice of names and comments do not generally aid understanding.,Cannot understand code. The reader cannot understand why the code works.
